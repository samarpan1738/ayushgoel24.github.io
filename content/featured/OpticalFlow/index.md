This project implements the Optical Flow by tracking pre-initialized bounding boxes in a video. The objective is to track the movement of the object of interest as the video plays.<br /><br />

The project uses the KLT Tracking algorithm to calculate the Optical Flow.<br /><br />

It then does Similarity Transformation estimation between the tracked points in any two frames to calcualte the movement of the object of interest.
