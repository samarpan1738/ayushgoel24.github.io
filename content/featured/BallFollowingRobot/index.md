Developed a Raspberry Pi-based robot that chases an object using PID control and a combination of sensory data (Camera and LiDAR). <br /><br />

Created a ROS package with three python scripts; one for detecting the centre of the object being tracked from images from Raspberry Pi; second for publishing angular position using LiDAR and camera data; third for sending appropriate velocity values to the actuators.
